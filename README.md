<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Features to be added

- [ ] I18N with French support
- [ ] Add an ErrorBoundary, I don't think it's error-prone atm due to the fairly easy features it provides (I'm delusional)
- [ ] Online capability with local time sync
- [ ] Better design (didn't have the time)
- [ ] Native notifications (requires some app signing)
- [ ] Support using your own songs as alarm
- [ ] Better way to handle useClock(), quite costly at the moment
- [ ] Remove DayJS as DatePicker adapter
- [ ] Jest tests
- [ ] GithubActions CI

See the [open issues](https://github.com/tefricker/voltime/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
